# Pandagram - Role-Based-Access

Pandagram is a simple React application that demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC) for user management. Users can log in, view tasks, and manage roles and tasks based on their access level (Admin, Manager, or Guest). The project utilizes React state, local storage for persistent data, and role-based UI rendering for a dynamic user experience.

# Features

User Roles:

Admin: Can manage roles, add new users, and assign tasks.
Manager: Can view tasks and delete them.
Guest: Can only view with no editing permissions.
Persistent Data: All user information is stored in the local storage, ensuring data persists even after page reloads.

Task Management: Admins and Managers can view assigned tasks. Admins have the ability to add or remove tasks.

Login System: Users can log in to the application and access role-specific features.
